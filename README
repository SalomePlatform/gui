--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <https://github.com/SalomePlatform/.github/wiki/SAT/>

Note: SALOME GUI module needs SALOME KERNEL as a pre-requisite.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir GUI_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd GUI_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME GUI
      module (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME GUI sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME GUI
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME GUI module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.
