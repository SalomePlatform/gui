Operations
##########

The functionalities of OCC viewer are available via its Viewer
Toolbar. Buttons marked with small downward triangles have extended
functionality which can be accessed by locking on them with left mouse
button.

mouse). By default, rotation in this mode is performed by left mouse
button, panning - by middle mouse button, zooming - by right mouse 
button. Selection in view by pressing "s" key works in both
styles.

.. _clipping_planes:

Clipping Planes
###############

**Clipping** allows creating cross-section views (clipping planes)
of your mesh.

To create a clipping plane, click on the **New** button in the dialog and choose how it will be defined by **Absolute** or **Relative** coordinates.

**Absolute Coordinates**

.. image:: ../images/Clipping_Absolute.png
	:align: center

- **Base point** - allows defining the coordinates of the base point for the clipping plane.

  - **Reset** - returns the base point to coordinate origin.

- **Direction** - allows defining the orientation of the clipping plane.

	- **Invert** - allows selecting, which part of the object will be removed and which will remain after clipping.

    
**Relative mode**  

.. image:: ../images/Clipping_Relative.png
	:align: center

- **Orientation** ( ||X-Y, ||X-Z or ||Y-Z).

- **Distance** between the opposite extremities of the boundary box of represented objects, if it is set to 0.5 the boundary box is split in two halves.

- **Rotation** (in angle degrees) **around X** (Y to Z) and **around Y** (X to Z) (depending on the chosen Orientation)

The other parameters are available in both modes : 

- **Active** checkbox is used to apply/erase current plane and it's affect to/from view.
- **Delete** removes the active clipping plane and discards it's view changes.
- **Disable all** deactivates all created clipping planes and clears **Auto Apply** checkbox.
- **Preview** check-box shows the clipping plane in the **3D Viewer**.
- **Auto Apply** check-box allows you to see the result of clipping in the **3D Viewer** immediately. Be careful, it is not a preview 2and Close button could not cancel the applied modifications.

It is also possible to interact with the clipping plane directly in 3D 
view using the mouse. 

____

.. image:: ../images/occ_view_sync.png
	:align: center

**Synchronize view** - allows to synchronize 3d view
parameters. This button has two states - checked and
unchecked. Clicking on this button opens a drop-down menu listing the
compatible 3d views. As soon as the user selects any view from the
list, the parameters (view point, position, zoom coefficient, etc.) of
the current view are synchronized with the selected view (static
synchronization).

In addition, when this button is in the "checked" state, the dynamic
synchronization of the views is performed, i.e. any zoom, pan, rotate
or other view operation done in one view is automatically applied to
the other view.

.. _env_texture:

Environment texture
###################

**Environment texture** - allows to set parameters for environment texture.

- **Environment texture** - enables/disables environment texture in the current OCCT 3D view.

User can select one of 7 predefined environment texture from the list or define its texture from file by 
choosing item **"Custom..."** in a combo box.

.. note:: 
	Environment texture file should normally satisfy the following requirements in order to produce good visual result:
		* The image file should have 2:1 width-to-height ratio.
		* It should constitute a 360-degrees panoramic image created using a fish-eye lens.

It's possible to choose a type of light source between directional and positional light.

.. image:: ../images/doc_dir_light_source.png

**Directional** light - creates a directional light source in the viewer.
It is defined by direction coordinates, color and headlight parameter.

It is also defined by the color and headlight parameter.

Click:

- **Default** to restore default values of light source.

- **Close** to return parameters of light source on initial values.
