Setting Preferences
*******************

All user preferences of **SALOME** application can be customized using the
common **Preferences** dialog box. This dialog can be open using the
***File > Preferences...*** menu item.

The **Preferences** dialog box consists of two parts:

- Available preferences sections are listed in the left part of the dialog box; usually this list contains "SALOME" item that specifies general application preferences and a separate section for each SALOME module available in the current session.
- The tabbed widget at the right side of the dialog box provides controls that can be used to customize the preferences.

.. note:: The preferences for modules become accessible only after explicit loading of these modules. Until then the dialog box will show the corresponding warning message. 

More detailed information about preferences for certain modules can be found in the User's guide of the corresponding module.

General application preferences are specified in the **SALOME** section
of the **Preferences** dialog box. These preferences affect on the
application look-n-feel and common functionality.

If the study has just been started and other
modules have not been loaded yet, it will be possible to change only the settings which refer to
the whole GUI SALOME session. 

General Preferences
###################

- **Study Properties**

  - **Multi file save** - if checked in, your study will be saved in several HDF files (one basic HDF file which will store the main information about the saved study and several other files for the data created by each component used during the study session). Opening of this study requires that **ALL** saved files should be stored in the **SAME** directory. If you would like to copy your saved study in another directory or machine, you should copy all stored files. Otherwise, if you try to open this study, some data will be lost and it will lead to invalid functioning of the SALOME platform. 
  - **ASCII save** - if checked in, your study will be saved in ASCII format file (or files).
  - **Automatic loading of light modules when opening study** -  if checked in, Light Modules of the current study will be automatically loaded at the next study opening, allowing completion of object browser.
  - **Store positions of windows** -  if checked in, positions of windows will be saved in a special file at the end of the current session and then restored for a new session.
  - **Store positions of toolbars** -  if checked in, positions of toolbars will be saved in a special file at the end of the current session and then restored for a new session.
  - **Auto-save interval (min)** - allows to specify the time interval (in minutes) for automatic study saving operation. If the time interval is equal to 0 ("Disabled" value is shown) the automatic saving is not performed.
  - **Store/restore last GUI state** - if checked in, all GUI settings are saved with the rest of the data whenever you save the study. When the study is reopened, the GUI state is restored.
  - **Publish in study in python dump** - if this option is switched on, the Python script resulting from Dump Python operation will include commands related to the publication of the data in the study (if this option is supported by specific module).
  - **Multi file python dump** - allows to generate multiple files (separately for each component) for dumping of a study to a python script. If the option is disabled, the study is dumped to a single python script.
  - **Save GUI state in python dump** - if this option is switched on, the Python script resulting from Dump Python operation will include commands related to the GUI state.

- **External browser** - allows to define what browser will be used to show SALOME reference manuals: internal (built-in SALOME browser) or external (IE, Netscape, Mozilla, ...). In addition, it is possible to specify 

    - **Application** - this option allows you to set an external browser (IE, Netscape) which will be used for viewing SALOME reference manuals. By default, Mozilla is used.

The preferences files usually have \*.xml extension. Also,
preferences files automatically saved by the application (stored in the
~/.config/salome directory) have no extension and by default start with
.SalomeApprc. followed by SALOME version number. Usually there is a
separate preferences file for each SALOME version in use. Preferences
are saved to the file in the end of the working session and restored
at the application start-up.

.. note:: 
	The preferences you set will be default preferences for all **new** objects, but they are not retroactive and do not automatically apply to the existing objects.
