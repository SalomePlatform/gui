  \class SALOME_Event
  \brief The class which encapsulates data and functionality required for 
         posting component-specific events to perform arbitrary operations 
         in the main GUI thread. 

  SALOME_Event objects can be posted by any thread belonging to the GUI process.
  
  It is necessary to derive a custom event class from SALOME_Event and 
  re-implement virtual Execute() method. This method should actually perform 
  the desirable operation. To pass all the required data to Execute() and 
  store a return value, arbitrary data fields can be added to the custom 
  event class. There is no need to protect such fields with a mutex, for only
  one thread working with a SALOME_Event object is active at any moment.
  
  Usage:
  - Create SALOME_Event. Components can derive their own event class from 
  SALOME_Event in order to pass custom data to the event handler.
  - Call process() method to post the event. After process() execution
  it is possible to examine fields of your custom event object.
  - Perform delete operator on the event to wake up the desktop (you can also 
  set <autoRelease>  parameter to \c true to automatically wake up desktop after 
  process().
  
  The method processed() is used by the desktop to signal that event processing 
  has been completed.

  To make all this work, it is necessary to call static method GetSessionThread()
  during the application initialization, i.e. from main() function.
  It is important to call this method from the primary application thread.

  Caveats: 
  - there are no.
