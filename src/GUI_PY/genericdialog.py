    be implemented in a derived class. The general interface that should be
    implemented in derived class is the MVC pattern:

    - setData(<a_data_model_object>):
      to initiate the values of the dialog windows from a given data model.

    - boolean checkData():
      to verify that the data are valid and notify user if not.

    - <a_data_model_object> getData():
      to get the valid data model from values read in the dialog window.
