# This file provides helper functions to drive some gui features of a
# SALOME Application (the selection in the object browser for now,
# further development coming soon). Note that some of these helper
# functions are specialized for a GEOM or SMESH context (see the
# guihelper.py modules comming with the packages salome.geom and
# salome.smesh.

# browser.

#
# Definitions:
# - the SObject is an item in the study (Study Object).
# - the entry is the identifier of an item.
# - the object (geom object or smesh object) is a CORBA servant
#   embedded in the SALOME component container and with a reference in
#   the SALOME study, so that it can be retrieved.
