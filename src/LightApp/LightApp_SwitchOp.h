 * \brief This class is intended for controling switching between operation
 *
 * Several operation may be launched simultaneously. This class is intended for
 * controlling switching between such operations. This class works with operations having
 * dialogs (activation of other operations is performed by SUIT_Study). When several
 * operations is launched simultaneously corresponding dialogs are shown on the screen.
 * Only one operation from the launched ones can be active (active operation). Other
 * operations are suspended. As result only one dialog from shown ones can be active too.
 * Other dialogs are disabled. This class installs event filter on application. When mouse
 * cursor is moved above disabled dialog corresponding event is catched by this class.
 * It finds corresponding operation and verify whether operation can be resumed (see
 * SUIT_Study::isDenied( SUIT_Operation* ) method). If yes then current active
 * operation is suspended and new operation activated. Module contains this class as a
 * field. Then module is created instance of this class created too.
